- I am mostly interested in anything related to Software Development and Game Development in general. I have experience in the areas of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. You can see this by following my pinned repos and the carreer path on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhat-reddy/). I have a M.Sc. in Computational Science from the Technical University of Munich, from the [Chair of Scientific Computing](https://https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/home/).
